## Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
Higher-Order Components (or HOCs, as cool kids call them) are basically functions that take a component and return a new, enhanced version of that component.

## HOCs offer some sweet benefits:

Code reuse: Because who wants to copy-paste code like it’s 1999?
Separation of concerns: Keepin’ it clean, focused, and modular.
Prop manipulation: Adding or modifying props.

## Common Use Cases for Higher-Order Components 

Authentication and Authorization
Data fetching and state management
Error handling and logging
Analytics and performance tracking
Theming and styling
